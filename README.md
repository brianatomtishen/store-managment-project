# Unit 2 - Management Poject

## INTRODUCTION

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** - Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** - Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** - Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** - Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** - Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.
## Optional Features
Use the this keyword 
Use the this keyword to refer to the current object's instance variables and/or to call another constructor in the class.
(some extra credit) Incorporate user interaction 
Use methods in the Scanner class to obtain user input to interact with your store management system
